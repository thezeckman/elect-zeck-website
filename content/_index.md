## Integrity Over Favoritism

**When the party spoke, the board didn't listen.**

In September 2025, the Pitt County Republican Party officially recommended Rich Zeck to fill a vacant District 6 Commissioner seat. The party's executive committee conducted a thorough vetting process—candidates submitted resumes, completed 19-page questionnaires, and answered questions for 21 minutes each.

The Board of Commissioners ignored the party's recommendation and appointed someone else.

> "Tonight, the Republican party brought forth a name to us that had been vetted and we completely ignored it. This board completely ignored it." — Commissioner Mark Smith

**This March, voters will decide.**
