## What Are Rich Zeck's Priorities for Pitt County?

Rich Zeck is running for Pitt County Commissioner District 6 on a platform of proven leadership, fiscal responsibility, and closing the rural divide. His priorities reflect the real needs of District 6 families—not political talking points.

These positions are based on Rich's 8 years as Mayor of Simpson, 10+ years leading the Council on Aging, and service on the ENC Alliance Board. He has seen firsthand what works and what doesn't in local government.

## 1. Closing the Rural Divide

### Why Does District 6 Feel Left Behind?

Many families in District 6 feel forgotten by county government. While Greenville and urban areas receive attention, rural communities struggle with inadequate infrastructure, limited broadband, and reduced access to essential services.

**Rich Zeck's Position:**
> "I will champion fair investment in infrastructure, broadband, and essential services—without unnecessary government expansion. Protecting our rural communities means ensuring they have the same access to opportunity as the rest of Pitt County."

**What Rich Will Fight For:**
- Fair distribution of county resources to rural areas
- Expanded broadband access for homes and businesses
- Essential services that reach every corner of District 6
- Representation for rural voices on the Board of Commissioners

## 2. Rural Healthcare Access

### How Can We Improve Healthcare in Rural Pitt County?

Rural families deserve timely, dependable healthcare. Long response times for EMS, limited access to specialists, and difficulty recruiting medical professionals create real hardship for District 6 residents.

**Rich Zeck's Position:**
> "I will push for expanded EMS coverage, partnerships with local health systems, telehealth access, and recruitment incentives for rural medical professionals. This keeps care local, reduces waiting times, and improves emergency response without raising taxes."

**What Rich Will Fight For:**
- Expanded EMS coverage and improved response times
- Partnerships with Vidant and other regional health systems
- Telehealth access to reduce barriers for rural patients
- Recruitment and retention incentives for rural healthcare workers
- Support for the ongoing fire and EMS feasibility study

**Rich's Perspective on EMS:**
> "Commissioners always need to base their decisions on the facts and not rely on emotions or promises. What matters is that commissioners do what is right and not worry about who is right."

## 3. Economic Development

### How Should Pitt County Grow?

Economic growth should benefit local families, not outside interests. Smart development attracts jobs, supports small businesses, grows the tax base, and ultimately lowers the burden on individual taxpayers.

**Rich Zeck's Position:**
> "Economic growth should benefit our families, not Raleigh insiders. I support responsible development that attracts jobs, supports small businesses, grows our tax base, and protects property rights. Smart growth fuels lower taxes and keeps more dollars circulating in Pitt County."

**What Rich Brings to This Issue:**

As an ENC Alliance Board Member, Rich has firsthand experience with regional economic development:

> "For the first time, private business owners, small and large, the city of Greenville, surrounding municipalities and GUC are all at the same table, moving in the same direction! This has put our County on the map INTERNATIONALLY."

**Rich's Economic Development Priorities:**
- Pro-business environment that attracts investment
- Support for small businesses, agriculture, and local industry
- Strategic use of incentives for high-impact opportunities
- Development of land inventory for future growth
- Openness to new sectors: technology, data centers, energy
- Rural communities positioned for technology and data opportunities

**What Rich Will Fight For:**
- County policies that support business growth
- Partnerships between county, cities, and private sector
- Investment in infrastructure that enables development
- Protection of property rights for landowners

## 4. Utility Expansion & Infrastructure

### Why Does Infrastructure Matter for District 6?

District 6 needs reliable utilities to grow. Without water, sewer, and modern infrastructure, businesses cannot locate here, and families face quality-of-life challenges. Infrastructure decisions must be based on need, not politics.

**Rich Zeck's Position:**
> "I will work to expand water, sewer, and prioritize projects based on need—not politics—and ensure funds are used efficiently. Modern infrastructure opens the door for business investment and improves the quality of life for every household."

**What Rich Will Fight For:**
- Expansion of water and sewer service to underserved areas
- Prioritization based on community need, not political connections
- Efficient use of infrastructure funds
- Planning that aligns infrastructure with growth
- Partnership with GUC for utility expansion

## 5. Career & Technical Education (CTE)

### What About Students Who Don't Want a Four-Year Degree?

Not every student needs a four-year college degree to succeed. Pitt County needs skilled workers in trades, healthcare, public safety, IT, and manufacturing. Expanding CTE creates pathways for students and fills workforce gaps for employers.

**Rich Zeck's Position:**
> "I will advocate for expanded Career & Technical Education, apprenticeships, and partnerships with local businesses, PCC, and trade programs. This creates workforce pipelines in welding, HVAC, healthcare, public safety, IT, and more—supporting both students and local employers."

**What Rich Will Fight For:**
- Expanded CTE programs in Pitt County Schools
- Apprenticeship partnerships with local businesses
- Connections between PCC and high school programs
- Training in high-demand fields: welding, HVAC, healthcare, IT
- Support for students pursuing skilled trades

## 6. Supporting First Responders

### How Can We Support the People Who Protect Us?

Firefighters, EMS teams, and deputies deserve dependable staffing, equipment, and training. Recruitment and retention challenges threaten public safety. A safe county starts with supporting the men and women who protect it.

**Rich Zeck's Position:**
> "I support strengthening recruitment and retention efforts and building skilled labor pipelines to fill shortages. A safe county starts with supporting the men and women who protect it every day."

**What Rich Will Fight For:**
- Competitive compensation to recruit and retain first responders
- Modern equipment and ongoing training
- Addressing staffing shortages proactively
- Support for volunteer fire departments
- Evidence-based response to the fire/EMS feasibility study

## 7. School Capacity & Education

### How Do We Handle Overcrowded Schools?

Pitt County's growth has outpaced school capacity. Trailers and mobile classrooms dot campuses across the district. Temporary fixes aren't enough—we need long-term planning that protects taxpayers.

**Rich Zeck's Position:**
> "I will push for long-term capacity planning, transparent budgeting, and reinvestment in classrooms, teachers, and classified staff—without burdening taxpayers. Smart planning today prevents expensive emergency building projects tomorrow."

**Rich's Perspective:**
> "Region 6 has seen accelerated growth and everyone has benefited from the building boom. Now where do these new owners send their children? Multiple schools are bursting at the seams, and no short-term plan is in place to remedy."

**What Rich Will Fight For:**
- Long-term school capacity planning
- Transparent budgeting for education spending
- Investment in permanent classroom space
- Consideration of creative solutions: reuse, modular classrooms
- Infrastructure planning that anticipates growth

## 8. Fiscal Responsibility

### How Will Rich Zeck Handle Taxpayer Dollars?

Financial responsibility is stewardship. Elected officials are stewards of constituents' tax dollars and have a moral obligation to maximize the return on that investment.

**Rich Zeck's Position:**
> "Financial responsibility is stewardship. As elected officials we are the stewards of our constituent's treasure therefore we have a moral and ethical obligation to get the best return on their investment into their community."

**Rich's Track Record:**

| Organization | Fiscal Achievement |
|--------------|-------------------|
| **Council on Aging** | 10+ years of fiscally conservative budgets with excellent federal, state, and funder audits |
| **Town of Simpson** | Rebuilt reserves after previous mismanagement |
| **Senior Center Expansion** | $1.6 million raised, project completed under budget |

**What Rich Will Fight For:**
- Evidence-based budget decisions
- Elimination of wasteful spending
- Support for organizations with proven impact
- Transparency in how tax dollars are allocated
- Conservative budgeting that focuses on sustainability
