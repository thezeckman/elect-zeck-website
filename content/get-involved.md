## Why Your Help Matters

Local elections are won by personal connections. In District 6, every conversation counts. When you:

- **Put up a yard sign** - You show neighbors that trusted community members support Rich
- **Knock on doors** - You give voters a personal introduction to the candidate
- **Make phone calls** - You remind people about early voting and Election Day
- **Share online** - You help friends learn about the campaign

The March 2026 primary will have low turnout. The campaign that reaches voters wins.

## About the Campaign

Rich Zeck is running for Pitt County Commissioner District 6. He is the four-term Mayor of Simpson, Executive Director of the Pitt County Council on Aging, and an ENC Alliance Board Member.

**Why we're running:** In September 2025, the Pitt County Republican Party recommended Rich Zeck to fill a vacant District 6 seat. The Board of Commissioners ignored the recommendation. Now voters will decide.
