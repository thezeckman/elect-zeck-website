        <h2>Who is Rich Zeck?</h2>
        <p>Rich grew up in Michigan, where he built a career in business and taught at Cornerstone University. Over a decade ago, he and his wife Michele made a deliberate choice to move to Pitt County—specifically to lead the Council on Aging and serve eastern North Carolina's seniors.</p>
        <p>What started as a job became a calling. Rich and Michele put down roots, and Rich threw himself into the community—visiting 50 churches in 50 weeks, knocking on every door in Simpson, and building relationships across every background.</p>
        <p>His philosophy is simple: God, Spouse, Family. Do what's right, not who's right. That's how he leads at home, at work, and in office.</p>

        <h2>Mayor of Simpson, NC</h2>
        <p>In 2017, Rich had lived in North Carolina for just 18 months. He ran anyway—personally visiting every household in Simpson, sitting down with Democrats, Republicans, the elderly, and disengaged voters alike. He unseated an incumbent who had held the position for over 20 years.</p>
        <p>The previous administration had left the town in financial disarray. Rich rebuilt the reserves, implemented fiscally conservative budgeting, and has been re-elected three more times. His ability to win across party lines isn't politics—it's proof that treating people with respect and dignity works.</p>
        <ul class="highlight-list">
          <li>Rebuilt town reserves after previous mismanagement</li>
          <li>Expanded infrastructure for sustainable growth</li>
          <li>Represents Simpson on the ENC Alliance Board of Directors</li>
          <li>Four consecutive election victories since 2017</li>

        <h2>Pitt County Council on Aging</h2>
        <p>Rich relocated to Pitt County over 10 years ago specifically to lead the Council on Aging. Under his direction, the organization has transformed into one of the premier senior service providers in North Carolina.</p>
        <p>During COVID-19, while other senior centers across the state shut down or reduced services, Rich's team never missed a single day of meal delivery. They raised $1.6 million for facility expansion during the height of the pandemic—opening a new facility ahead of schedule and under budget.</p>
        <ul class="highlight-list">
          <li>Grew from 1 to 6 senior wellness centers across Pitt County</li>
          <li>350-400 hot meals delivered daily through Meals on Wheels</li>
          <li>850 seniors served each week across all programs</li>
